# Intro to ML

## Reading (also for lecture 2): ESL Chapter 2

## Installs

Do the following things to get your python editor, jupyter notebook, python, and packages.

1. Install conda on your machine, go to [the Continuum website](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) and get anaconda 3.  This will install python 3.6 on your machine.
2. In a shell (such as terminal or cygwin) you can type `conda list` and see what packages you have available.
3. When you do not have a package that you need you should install it with `conda install packagename` in the terminal.  Right away you should make sure you have `jupyter`, `numpy`, `scipy`, and `scikit-learn`.
4. You will also need a text editor, preferably with an IDE (integrated development environment).  You can use `spyder` which you can also install with conda.  Here is the [documentation](https://pythonhosted.org/spyder/).
