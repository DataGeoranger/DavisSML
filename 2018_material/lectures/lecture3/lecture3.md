# Lecture 3: Ridge regression and subset selection

The goal of this section is to go over subset selection and ridge regression.  The point of these developments are:
1. both can make linear regression more well conditioned - the solution will be more stable
1. subset selection can be used to find the most significant variables

The main ideas are 
1. Ridge regression is based on the idea of regularization, which will reappear!
1. Subset selection is a difficult problem, but is often what is of interest
1. We look at greedy methods for solving the subset selection problem
1. Matrix decomposition can be used to solve linear regression and understand the effect of regularization
