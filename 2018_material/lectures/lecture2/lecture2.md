## Git

You are going to need to use git, so you should take this time to:
1. install git: you can either install it for the command line (google that) or install the github desktop app:https://desktop.github.com/
2. clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/jsharpna/DavisSML.git`
3. navigate to the DavisSML/lectures/lecture2 folder (use `cd`) and run `jupyter notebook` 
4. open the lecture2.ipynb file in jupyter
5. in your free time you should learn about git: https://jsharpna.github.io/141B/git_instructions.html
